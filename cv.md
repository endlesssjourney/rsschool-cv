## I am 18 years old, studying at the university in Warsaw to become a programmer. I signed up for the courses to gain more experience and knowledge here. I will try very hard to successfully complete all the stages, not just the first one. I know English pretty well, I've been tutored twice, and I'm also stress-resistant.

## I studied c#, I know css and html well.

```JavaScript
function evenOrOdd(number) {
  return number % 2 === 0 ? "Even": "Odd"
}
```

the simplest task of codewars

## I have no work experience, I am currently studying in the 1st year.

## The English level is not very high, but not bad. The practice was at the university
