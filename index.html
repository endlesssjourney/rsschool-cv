        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am 18 years old, studying at the university in Warsaw to become a
          programmer. I signed up for the courses to gain more experience and
          knowledge here. I will try very hard to successfully complete all the
          stages, not just the first one. I know English pretty well, I've been
          tutored twice a week, and I'm also stress-resistant.
        </p>
